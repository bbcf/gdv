### GENOME DATA VIEWER ###
##########################

GDV is a Genome browser developed at the Bioinformatics & Biostatistics Core Facility, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.
It’s goal is to provide biologists and bio-analysts a fast, browsable and editable view of their data along the genome. Once achieved, the user will be able to launch different statistics modules on his data and thus prepare all the mining process of the analysis.

### INSTALL ###

1) clone the project :
 
	$git clone git://github.com/bbcf/gdv.git

2) go to GDV_HOME

	$cd gdv

3) there are few configurations files that you need to edit by hand. You can find them at these locations :

	- GDV_HOME/src/main/webapp/META-INF/gdv.yaml :
	 	configure the GDV application 
	- GDV_HOME/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml :
		the only param you should change is 
		<init-param>
			<param-name>configuration</param-name>
		  	<param-value>{deployment or development}</param-value>
		</init-param>
		and put it as deployment
	- GDV_HOME/pom.xml :
		the configuration for MAVEN
		you should change the difference parameters on top of the script

(more information on these files can be found on the *.example files)

4) run the script of first installation
	
	$./build_scripts/first_install.sh $GDV_HOME $INSTALL_PATH (see notes)

($GDV_HOME must be the full path where gdv project is located)

5) make the war archive to deploy it on TOMCAT

	$./build_scripts/archive_gdv.sh $GDV_HOME

### NOTES ###
For the script first_install.sh you need to provide an INSTALL_PATH.
This one must be on the same machine than TOMCAT. It will contains all resources needed
by GDV to be functional, and must have a large storage because each track created by GDV will be 
kept on the filesystem.


### DEPENDENCIES ###

- GDV is build and archived using MAVEN : http://maven.apache.org/

- GDV use ANT for some dependencies : http://ant.apache.org/

- local dependencies can be installed via the script GDV_HOME/build_scripts/install_local_ressources.sh (note that it will be automatically run on the first installation)
- GDV can be deployed on TOMCAT : http://tomcat.apache.org/
