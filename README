### GENOME DATA VIEWER ###
##########################

GDV is a Genome browser developed at the Bioinformatics & Biostatistics Core Facility, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.
It’s goal is to provide biologists and bio-analysts a fast, browsable and editable view of their data along the genome. Once achieved, the user will be able to launch different statistics modules on his data and thus prepare all the mining process of the analysis.

### INSTALL ###

1) clone the project :
 
	$git clone git://github.com/bbcf/gdv.git

2) go to GDV_HOME

	$cd gdv

WARNING : ensure that you have ANT and MAVEN installed (see DEPENDENCIES section)

3) edit the file 'gdv.properties' and change parameters that suit your configuration

4) run the script of first installation 
	
	$./build_scripts/first_install.sh $GDV_HOME

($GDV_HOME must be the full path where gdv project is located . It's the path where you cloned the project.)

NOTE : this script is just an helper, you must ensure that every step is ok. especially the last one, to build the database.

5) make the war archive to deploy it on TOMCAT

	$./build_scripts/archive_gdv.sh $GDV_HOME

6) copy the war archive in target directory in TOMCAT webapps

7) edit your httpd conf file to work with TOMCAT and to make some directory public & accessible
from URL (the "public" & "tracks" directories)

### NOTES ###
For the script first_install.sh you need to provide an INSTALL_PATH.
This one must be on the same machine than TOMCAT. It will contains all resources needed
by GDV to be functional, and must have a large storage because each track created by GDV will be 
kept on the filesystem.


### DEPENDENCIES ###

- GDV is build and archived using MAVEN : http://maven.apache.org/

- GDV use ANT for some dependencies : http://ant.apache.org/

- local dependencies can be installed via the script GDV_HOME/build_scripts/install_local_ressources.sh (note that it will be automatically run on the first installation)
- GDV can be deployed on TOMCAT : http://tomcat.apache.org/
