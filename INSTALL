######################## REQUIREMENT ###########################
################################################################
A) Java Development Kit 1.6

   You need JDK 1.6 to run the application.
   1) Download it at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
   
   2) Follow this instructions : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/index-137561.html
   
   3) Perhaps you will need to update your JAVA_HOME. You can do it with the following command :
      	      $ export JAVA_HOME=/<path where you installed the jdk> 


B) Apache Tomcat
   
   You need Apache Tomcat to deploy the application.
   1) Download it at http://tomcat.apache.org/ (the latest version)
      (select the Core zip or tgz)
   
   2) Uncompress it and put it somewhere like /srv.
      So you should have something like /srv/apache-tomcat-<version>
      This path will be called $CATALINA_HOME

   3) You could start it with the command :
      	  $ sh $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh 
      
   4) At this point you should see something on your browser at http://localhost:8080/ .
      
      If not, perhaps you have already somethind running on port 8080.
      You can change it in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml .
      Search for the line  <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
      and change here the port to another.
      If it's still not working I'm redirecting you to 
      the official documentation od Apache Tomcat.

C) PostgreSQL
   
   GDV use PostgreSQL as it's database system.
   1) Download it at : http://www.postgresql.org/download/

   2) Install it by following the steps that you could find at http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides

   3) At this step you should be able to run (with correct user):
      	 $ createdb db_test
      	 $ psql db_test
      	 db_test=> \q 
      	 $ dropdb db_test
      If not, you could have missed something : back to point 2)


D) Git

   You need git for the installations steps of GDV.
   1) Download and Install it with your package manager 
      You should see this great tutorial if you don't know how to do it :
      http://progit.org/book/ch1-4.html
      (note that on OSX you could also use homebrew to install it : http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)

####################### INSTALLATION ###########################
################################################################


1) Download the latest gdv archive at http://salt.epfl.ch/java/gdv-archive/current/gdv.tgz
   Untar it :
   	 $ tar -xvzf gdv.tgz
   And the directory created, we will call it $GDV_HOME

2) Edit the file under $GDV_HOME/bin/META-INF/gdv.yaml
   This file doesn't exist but you have gdv.yaml.example under the same
   directory. Just remove the .example & edit it.
   
   This file should be correctly edited in order to GDV to be functionnal.
   See the section "GDV CONFIGURATION" below.
   	

3) Archive  gdv.war :
   	   $ cd $GDV_HOME/bin
	   $ jar cvf gdv.war .

4) GDV application must know where Tomcat is installed :
       $ export CATALINA_HOME=<path where tomcat is installed> (previously called $CATALINA_HOME itself)

5) GDV daemons (other process that will start along GDV application) need to know where GDV is installed
       $ export GDV_HOME=<path where GDV is installed> (previously called $GDV_HOME itsefl)

6) Put gdv.war under Tomcat webapps directory :
       $ mv $GDV_HOME/bin/gdv.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/.
   - If you are still with the 'default' installation of Tomcat, GDV would start
     automatically.

   - Either you could launch the application with the web manager of tomcat : 
    edit the file $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml
    and enter the following lines :
   
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
    <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/>	

    (this lines refer to apache Tomcat 7, for other versions, see the documentation : http://tomcat.apache.org/)
    (you can of course change the password & username)

    You should be able to access the manager here : http://localhost:8080/manager/html 


6) Access gdv to http://localhost:8080/gdv
